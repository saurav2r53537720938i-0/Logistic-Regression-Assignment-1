    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both technique used in statistcal modeling but they serve diffrent purpose and are suited for diffrent types of data.\n",
    "1. Linear Regression: Linear regression is used when the dependent variable is continous and the relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.It predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the value of indpendent variable.\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression:Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical with two or more categories and the relationship between the independent variable and categorical outcome is non-linear.It predicts the probality that a given observation belong to a particular category"
